SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell module for managing Privileged Identity Management (PIM) role
    activations through a graphical interface.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The PIMActivation module provides a modern Windows Forms-based interface
    for activating eligible PIM roles in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
    and PIM-enabled groups. It simplifies the process of discovering and
    activating multiple roles simultaneously while respecting policy requirements.

    Key Features:
    - Graphical user interface for easy role management
    - Support for Entra ID directory roles
    - Support for PIM-enabled security groups
    - Optional support for Azure resource roles
    - Multi-select capability for bulk activations
    - Configurable activation duration (1-24 hours)
    - Automatic handling of policy requirements:
      * Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
      * Justification text
      * Ticket information
      * Authentication context
      * Approval workflows
    - Real-time view of active and eligible roles
    - Account switching without restarting

EXAMPLES
    # Launch with default settings (Entra roles and Groups)
    Start-PIMActivation

    # Include only Entra ID roles
    Start-PIMActivation -IncludeEntraRoles

    # Include only PIM-enabled groups
    Start-PIMActivation -IncludeGroups

    # Include all role types including Azure resources
    Start-PIMActivation -IncludeEntraRoles -IncludeGroups -IncludeAzureResources

    - PowerShell 7+ (Download from https://aka.ms/powershell)
    - Windows operating system (for Windows Forms support)
    - Microsoft.Graph PowerShell modules
    - Appropriate permissions in Entra ID
    - Az.Accounts module (optional, for Azure resource roles)

INSTALLATION
    Install-Module -Name PIMActivation -Scope CurrentUser

TROUBLESHOOTING
    Common Issues:

       - Check if Microsoft.Graph modules are installed
       - Verify network connectivity

    2. "No eligible roles found"
       - Verify you have PIM-eligible role assignments
       - Check if the correct role types are enabled
       - Ensure PIM is enabled in your tenant

    3. "Az.Accounts module not found"
